# CPP-Arrays #Assign 10
Given an array A[] consisting of N integers from a range [1, N], the task is to calculate the count of
array elements (non-distinct) that can be represented as the sum of two or more consecutive array
elements.
Input: a[] = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5}
Output: 5
Explanation:
The array elements satisfying the condition are:
4 = 3 + 1
5 = 1 + 4 or 4 + 1
9 = 3 + 1 + 4 + 1
6 = 1 + 5 or 1 + 4 + 1
5 = 1 + 4 or 4 + 1
Input: a[] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
Output: 0
